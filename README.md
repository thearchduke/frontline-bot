Wrapper around [gpt-2-simple](https://github.com/minimaxir/gpt-2-simple) package. See that for actual docs. No rights reserved.

If you end up in dependency hell, try just installing `gpt-2-simple` and `tensorflow`.

I haven't tested this, but you should be able to get away with `tensorflow-gpu` instead with minimal changes.
